Poster Title: Utilizing Response Time Models Throughout a Therapeutic Yoga Intervention

Abstract:  One of the many side effects of cancer and its treatment is a form of impairment called cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD). Difficulties in consistently measuring CRCD have hindered progress in understanding the underlying mechanisms of this impairment, resulting in ripple effects on the development of effective treatments. In this study, we measured a multitude of health outcomes across a 6-month study of Texas women who have been diagnosed with cancer. By utilizing a holistic approach that integrates therapeutic yoga with motivational support and dietary guidance, we aimed to improve quality-of-life for these cancer patients and survivors. To assess changes in CRCD throughout the study, we assessed attention, executive control, and working memory at monthly intervals with neuropsychological tasks. The data was assessed with three response time models, as a sensitive and theoretically meaningful alternative to mean-based analyses. This set of analyses on preliminary data raises a discussion on future response time modeling implementation in the health sciences.
